>For the application to work properly, the following application properties must be set at the JVM level:
>
>- app.name: This property specifies the name of the application.
>- app.version: This property specifies the version of the application.
>   - This SemVer-like format is only numeric MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.3).

### Windows how to run in IntelliJ IDEA
